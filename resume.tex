\runsubsection{Huawei}\descript{| General Software Engineer}\hfill \location{Jan 2020 – Present}
\begin{tightemize}
	\item Utilized API Designer to design RESTful API\textquotesingle{}s, constructed relevant Spring Cloud projects, and generated Swagger documentation pages
	\item Used Multi-threaded programming (double-checked locking, CAS, and thread pool) to design and implement AtlasTaskDispatch microservice which can serve thousands of concurrent requests
	\item Created pipelines in Jenkins, generated relevant analyses, and stored pipeline info in Redis
	\item Utilized Load Balancing Algorithms to design AtlasPerformanceService to connect the machine with the lowest load to AtlasTaskDispatch
	\item To overcome the single point of failure in Redis, performance bottleneck and storage limit, configured Redis clusters and replaced Jedis with Redisson
	\item Developed several Jenkins plugins to improve efficiency, including CheckBuildToolsPlugin, MooseFSPlugin and ChatForJenkins
	\item Used Spring AOP to create HttpUtils class to obtain detailed records of each request and response
